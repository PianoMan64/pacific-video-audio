#### Database Schema Preview
```sql
-- Products table
CREATE TABLE Products (
    Id INT IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    Name NVARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    Description NVARCHAR(MAX),
    Price DECIMAL(18,2) NOT NULL,
    CategoryId INT,
    ImageUrl NVARCHAR(500),
    IsActive BIT DEFAULT 1,
    CreatedDate DATETIME2 DEFAULT GETDATE()
);

-- Categories table
CREATE TABLE Categories (
    Id INT IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    Name NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Description NVARCHAR(500),
    ParentCategoryId INT NULL
);

-- Users/Customers (extends Identity tables)
-- Cart items for persistent storage
-- Orders and order items
-- Service packages and bookings
```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Functional shopping cart with persistent state
- [ ] User registration and authentication working
- [ ] Product catalog with database integration
- [ ] Basic order processing workflow
- [ ] Payment gateway integration (test mode)
- [ ] Responsive design maintained
- [ ] All existing features preserved

### Testing Plan
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for data access
- UI tests for critical user flows
- Payment gateway testing in sandbox mode

### Timeline Estimate
- **Week 1**: Project structure and database setup
- **Week 2**: Product management and catalog
- **Week 3**: Shopping cart implementation
- **Week 4**: User authentication and orders
- **Week 5**: Payment integration and testing

**Next Steps**: 
1. Set up the project structure with separate class libraries
2. Configure Entity Framework Core with SQL Server
3. Begin implementing the product catalog functionality
